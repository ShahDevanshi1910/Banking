 Banking Managament Project


Problem Statement/ Opportunity : 
The traditional banking system often involves time-consuming and inconvenient processes for customers, such as visiting physical branches and waiting in long queues. There is a need for a modern banking management website that addresses these challenges and provides customers with a seamless online banking experience. The website aims to improve customer satisfaction, convenience, and security while offering a wide range of banking services. 


Project Description : 
The traditional banking system often lacks efficient digital solutions, leading to inconvenience and time-consuming processes for customers. This creates a need for a banking management website that addresses the following challenges:
Limited Accessibility: Customers face difficulties accessing banking services outside of traditional banking hours or physical branches. There is a lack of 24/7 availability, resulting in inconvenience and restricted access to banking services.
Cumbersome Account Management: Customers struggle with managing their accounts, including checking balances, reviewing transaction history, and updating personal information. The existing banking systems may have complex user interfaces or limited functionality, hindering efficient account management.
